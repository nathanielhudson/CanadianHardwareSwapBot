        Hello!
        
        EMT, Bitcoin and other electronic payment methods that do not have anti-scam prevention are now banned. PayPal Goods and Services is the only electronic payment method allowed on /r/canadianhardwareswap at this time. For more details please see https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianHardwareSwap/comments/feyqji/electronic_payment_methods_other_than_paypal_gs/ . Please create a new post, but removing the offending payment mods from your title.

        I'm just a bot, and I'm sorry if I got it wrong - if I did, please message the mods to let them know. Have a nice day!

        Hello!
        
        Thank you for posting to /r/CanadianHardwareSwap. We want to remind you to that "local only" buying and selling threads are only allowed for items that are very expensive to ship - for example, monitors and cases. Smaller items, such as GPUs, Keyboards, or SSDs CANNOT be listed as "local only".
        
        If your post contains a prohibited item listed as local only, please delete it immediately, and create a new post that follows our rules. If you are unable or unwilling to ship the item, consider alternative forums, such as Kijiji. If you have any questions, please message the mods.
        
        This message was automatically sent because your post contains the phrase "local". I'm just a bot, and I'm sorry if I got it wrong. Have a nice day!
